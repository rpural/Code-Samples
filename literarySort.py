üêç PYTHON CODE CHALLENGE - SPECIAL SEATING

# you're planning a dinner for a special literary society, and seating arrangement is very particular. Create a Python function: sort_names, sorting list of names first by length of name and then alphabetically.  This way, everyone can find their seats with ease!

names = ["Ava", "Ella", "Emma", "Liam", "Lucas", "Mia", "Noah", "Oliver", "Sophia", "William"]

def sort_names(names):

# Your code here

pass

# Test your function to ensure it correctly sorts the names

sorted_names = sort_names(names)

print(sorted_names)

# Bonus:

# modify function to make sure the chairman and founder, Oliver comes last.

Please share your code in a format that is easy for others to copy and test üëç

Have fun
